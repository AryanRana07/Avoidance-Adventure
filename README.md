## Avoidance Adventure
In my Python project, "Avoidance Adventure" I designed an interactive game using the Pygame library. Players navigate a red box at the screen's bottom, using arrow keys to avoid colliding with descending blue boxes. The challenge lies in precise control and quick reflexes, making it an engaging and thrilling gaming experience.
